# ChatBot using AIML
Chatbots are software applications that use artificial intelligence & natural language processing to understand what a human wants, and guides them to their desired outcome with as little work for the end user as possible. Like a virtual assistant for your customer experience touchpoints.
In this project we have built a Chatbot using PyTorch and focussing on the use of Neural Networks.
